Reading Discussion 1


What a fascinating and frustrating read. Norman's "The Design of Everyday Things" feels less like a textbook and more like a mirror reflecting all the subtle annoyances and triumphs of my daily life. Chapter 1, in particular, has me thinking about how much I take for granted about the objects I interact with.
The concept of affordances is the most compelling idea for me so far. Norman defines it as the perceived and actual properties of a thing that determine how it could possibly be used (p. 9). I've never had a word for this before, but I've certainly experienced it. I was at a friend's house the other day, and their new kettle had a handle that just seemed to fit my hand perfectly. It felt natural and intuitive. This is a perfect example of an object whose design afforded a clear and easy use. On the flip side, I've struggled with doors that have no clear indication of whether they should be pushed or pulled, a classic Norman example. The lack of an affordance leads to frustration.
Another topic that resonates deeply is the idea of conceptual models. Norman states that a good design allows us to create a clear and accurate mental model of how something works (p. 31). I recently bought a new printer, and the setup was a nightmare. The instruction manual was a series of vague images, and the printer's buttons and lights seemed to have no logical connection to its functions. My mental model of its operation was completely wrong, leading to multiple failed attempts at printing. This contrasts sharply with my phone, which, despite its complexity, has a very clear and consistent conceptual model. The icons, gestures, and settings all make sense together.
