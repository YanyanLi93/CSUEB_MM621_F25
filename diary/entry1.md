# Reading Discussion 1


What a fascinating and frustrating read. Norman's "The Design of Everyday Things" feels less like a textbook and more like a mirror reflecting all the subtle annoyances and triumphs of my daily life. Chapter 1, in particular, has me thinking about how much I take for granted about the objects I interact with.

Norman introduces the concept of **affordances**, <ins>the qualities of an object that suggest how it can be used (p. 10)</ins>. This made me think of the new touch-screen thermostat in my apartment. It looks sleek, but it’s incredibly confusing to use. There’s no clear indication of what areas are touch-sensitive or how to adjust the temperature. I ended up turning on the air conditioning when I was trying to turn on the heat. The affordances are either missing or misleading, which makes the device frustrating rather than helpful.

Another concept that resonated with me was **feedback**(p. 23), <ins>which Norman describes as the signal that lets a user know an action has been received and processed</ins>. A lack of feedback is something I experience regularly with the touch-sensitive elevator buttons in my apartment building. When I press a floor number, there’s no light or sound to confirm my input, so I often end up pressing it again unnecessarily. This chapter made me realize how crucial good design is—not just for usability, but for reducing frustration and building confidence in how we interact with technology.
