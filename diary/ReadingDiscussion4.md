**1. The Faucet Case: When Intuitive Design Fails**

Norman describes a faucet in a British dormitory that looked like it should turn, but in fact had to be pushed down to work. Many users were confused or had to ask for help.
Main idea:

The appearance (signifier) must match the intended action.

If a designer wants users to push, the object must look pushable; if it should turn, it must look turnable.
This shows how powerful signifiers are — they tell people how to interact with things without instructions.

This is another faucet example. From this angle, customers can only see the blue symbol representing cold water on the switch. This makes them inclined to turn the switch towards their direction.

However, when people look at it from a different angle or get closer, they will find that the cold water is actually in another direction, because there are very small arrows.

2. Human Mental Models vs. Physical Structure

Norman notes that a faucet seems simple, but the user’s goals (controlling temperature and flow) conflict with the physical structure of the device (two pipes: hot and cold).
He lists different faucet designs (dual knobs, single lever, motion-sensor, etc.) to show that designers must base their work on the psychological conceptual model — how people think things should work — rather than the mechanical structure hidden inside.
Key idea: Design should make sense to people, not just to engineers.

3. Standardization and Cultural Constraints

When intuitive design isn’t enough, standards and cultural conventions help users know what to expect.
For example, the direction of faucet handles or the meaning of colors (red for hot, blue for cold) should be standardized.
Conclusion: Standards should follow human psychology, not mechanical logic.
They make life easier, even though they may slow innovation.

4. Using Sound as Signifiers

Not everything can be seen — sometimes sound communicates best. Norman explains that natural sounds (a door latch clicking, a kettle whistling, toast popping up) provide valuable feedback about system status.
In contrast, artificial beeps and buzzes are often uninformative and annoying.
                                                                       
Good sound design:

Uses rich, natural sounds.

Gives useful information without becoming intrusive.

Allows users to “hear” how things are working, even when their eyes are busy.

5. Conclusion: Balancing Consistency and Improvement

Norman ends the chapter by emphasizing:

Consistency helps users transfer what they’ve learned to new products.

However, radical improvements sometimes require breaking conventions.

Designers must ensure that even new systems remain intuitive and easy to learn.
