Norman points out that when people perform any action, they go through seven psychological stages — from setting a goal and forming an intention to executing the action and evaluating the result. This model helps designers understand the structure of human behavior, enabling them to create more intuitive products. In our daily life, when people buy a drink from a vending machine, they first decide they want a cola (goal), press the button (execution), and then check if the drink drops (evaluation). If the machine doesn’t respond, they might try again or assume it’s broken — this reflects the “gulf of execution” and the “gulf of evaluation.”

Another statement Norman mentions in this chapter is that people form mental models of how things work through observation or experience. Clear design helps users build accurate models and reduces operational errors. If a car’s gear lever must be pushed forward to reverse, it can confuse people—because intuitively, “pushing forward = moving forward.” This shows that the conceptual model doesn’t match the user’s expectations.
